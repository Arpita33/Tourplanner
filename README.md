# Tourplanner
Term Project for Software Engineering course:
In this project we built a website that helps users plan tours given the destinations and time budget. We used the Python Django framework for building the website. 
Front end was built using HTML, CSS and backend using Python. We used MySQL as our DBMS and Map API for finding distance between destinations. 
The main algorithm implemented in this website is the Traveling Salesman Problem.
